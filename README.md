# Coding Challenges

My coding challenges and their solutions.

## Introduction

The part of the brain that solves logical problem in fields like coding and math, is like a muscle. The more you practice and the more problems you solve, the better and more resilient you become. Improve incrementally, each day, even 0.01% and before you know, the power of compound effect will catapult you.

## Need For Better Problem Solvers

Almost all people who get into companies like Google, Facebook, AirBnB often talks about how they perfected their problem solving skills by going to websites where they could find coding challenges and get better each day, such stories motivate me a lot because it reminds us that even the best of the best started at some point, just like us, they became frustrated when they couldn't solve a problem but they kept at it and became the best.

AAA Companies hire people with superior problem solving ability, that's the reason these companies are the best because they hire the top people. You CAN become that top people, there is no secret pill that you can take. If you have average to above average IQ and are willing, you can do it.

## My Journey

This isn't just a repo, this is my journey to becoming better problem solver. Although I've been coding for two years now, there is so much more for me to learn still.
